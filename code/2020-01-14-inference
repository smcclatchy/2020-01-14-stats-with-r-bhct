Selected Problems from pages 70-74
3. Because of the symmetry of the standard normal distribution, there is a simpler way to calculate the probability that a t-value under the null could have a larger absolute value than tval. Choose the simplified calculation from the following:

A) 1-2*pnorm(abs(tval))
B)1-2*pnorm(-abs(tval))
C)1-pnorm(-abs(tval))
D)2*pnorm(-abs(tval))+++++

qnorm(1 - 0.01/2)*se 


5. If instead of CLT, we use the t-distribution approximation, what do we add and subtract (use 2*N-2 degrees of freedom)?
Paste your solution below.
qt(.995, 2*N-2) => 2.68 =>  Difference +/- (2.68*Standard Error)


6. Why are the values from 4 and 5 so similar?
A) Coincidence.+++
B) They are both related to 99% confidence intervals.
C) N and thus the degrees of freedom is large enough to make the normal and t-distributions very similar.  ++
D) They are actually quite different, differing by more than 1 ounce.

7. Which of the following sentences about a Type I error is not true?
A) The following is another way to describe a Type I error: you decided to reject the null hypothesis on the basis of data that was actually generated by the null hypothesis.
B) The following is another way to describe a Type I error: due to random fluctuations, even though the data you observed were actually generated by the null hypothesis, the p-value calculated from the observed data was small, so you rejected it.
C) From the original data alone, you can tell whether you have made a Type I error. ++
D) In scientific practice, a Type I error constitutes reporting a “significant” result when there is actually no result.

9. The p-value is larger than 0.05 so using the typical cut-off, we would not reject. This is a type II error. Which of the following is not a way to decrease this type of error? 
A) Increase our chance of a type I error.
B) Take a larger sample size.+
C) Find a population for which the null is not true.+
D) Use a higher alpha level.
